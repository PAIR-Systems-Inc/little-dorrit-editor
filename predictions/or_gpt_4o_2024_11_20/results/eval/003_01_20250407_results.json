The predicted edit correctly reflects this change, focusing only on the word 'Travellers' and thus accurately capturing the essential punctuation addition. Since additional context (e.g., including 'Fellow') is allowed but is not strictly necessary, this prediction still accurately represents the core intention of the ground truth edit."
