The predicted text content ('yonder to-day' \u2192 'yonder, to-day') exactly matches the ground truth edit as well. The predicted edit correctly captures the intended punctuation insertion (comma after 'yonder'). The difference in the page identifier ('003.png' vs '19') is irrelevant to this evaluation based on the stated criteria. Therefore, both essential criteria (edit type and text content accuracy) are fully satisfied."

By the criteria provided, extra context is allowed as long as the essential edit is accurately preserved. Therefore, the prediction is considered correct."
