Second, the text content accuracy is also correctly captured\u2014the predicted edit transforms 'shore and' into 'shore, and', precisely reflecting the core punctuation change indicated by the ground truth. Additional or differing context around this edit is not present, and no discrepancy exists. Given that line numbers are explicitly ignored for evaluation, the discrepancy in line_number is inconsequential. Thus, the prediction accurately captures the intention of the original editorial correction."

Regarding text content accuracy, the predicted edit ('that once' \u2192 'than once') completely captures the intended textual change from the ground truth ('that' \u2192 'than'). The prediction includes extra context ('once'), but this additional context does not alter or obscure the core correction (the word 'that' changed to 'than'). Thus, the essential edit (the actual textual change from 'that' to 'than') is correctly represented within the predicted edit. Therefore, both criteria for correctness are fulfilled."
