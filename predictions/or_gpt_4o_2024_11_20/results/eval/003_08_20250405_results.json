The essential punctuation change from 'howling over' to 'howling, over' is accurately captured within the predicted correction 'howling, over yonder, to-day, sir.' The predicted edit correctly reflects the core change identified by the ground truth, and the additional context ('yonder, to-day, sir') does not impede or alter the essential correction. Therefore, the edit type and core text correction are completely accurate with regard to the ground truth."

Secondly, although the predicted edit includes additional surrounding words ('rattling'), the essential punctuation correction ('pockets and' \u2192 'pockets, and') is correctly captured. Extra surrounding context is allowed as per instructions, as long as the core change is correct, which it is in this case. Therefore, the prediction is correct."
