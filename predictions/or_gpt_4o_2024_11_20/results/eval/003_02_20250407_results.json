Although the prediction omits the word 'Fellow', it correctly captures the intended punctuation correction ('Travellers' to 'Travellers.'). According to evaluation criteria, the prediction is acceptable because it accurately reflects the essential punctuation edit identified by the ground truth edit."

The additional word 'rattling' in the context of the prediction does not alter or diminish the accuracy of the core punctuation correction, as the essential edit is clearly preserved.
