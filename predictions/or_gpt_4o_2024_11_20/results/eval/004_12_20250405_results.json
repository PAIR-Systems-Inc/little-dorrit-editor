Regarding the text content, the ground truth capitalizes 'why' at the beginning of a phrase: 'why did he dine' to 'Why did he dine'. The predicted edit also focuses correctly on capitalizing the initial word 'why' to 'Why'. Even though the ground truth includes additional context ('did he dine') and the prediction focuses solely on the initial word 'why', the key core edit (capitalizing 'why') is accurately captured. Therefore, both type and essential text content match the ground truth's intention."
