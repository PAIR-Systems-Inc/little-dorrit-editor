The predicted edit ('existence at' \u2192 'existence, at') accurately captures this essential edit, with additional context included ('at'). According to the evaluation criteria provided, additional context in the predicted edit is allowed if the core edit is correctly identified.

The predicted edit includes additional context ('by' after the comma), but this does not affect correctness, as the core change 'view' \u2192 'view,' is accurately captured.
