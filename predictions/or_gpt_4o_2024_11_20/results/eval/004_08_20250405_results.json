Additionally, the predicted change 'why' \u2192 'Why' correctly captures the essential capitalization edit identified by the ground truth ('why did he dine' \u2192 'Why did he dine'). Although the prediction presents only one word ('why') rather than the entire phrase ('why did he dine'), this still successfully captures the core edit intention (capitalizing the first word). Thus, both edit type and the essential text content change are accurately represented, and the prediction is correct according to the evaluation criteria."
