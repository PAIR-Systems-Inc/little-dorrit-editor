The essential textual change from lowercase 'why' to capitalized 'Why' is correctly captured by the prediction. Although the predicted edit isolates only the word 'why', and the ground truth includes additional context ('why did he dine'), this additional context is not required; the critical core correction\u2014capitalization of 'why'\u2014is fully and accurately represented. Therefore, both the edit type and essential textual edit match the ground truth's intention."
