The core textual change, namely adding a comma after 'shore', making 'shore and' into 'shore, and', exactly captures the intended correction shown by the ground truth. Additional context and line numbers were explicitly ignored as per instruction, and since both the edit type and essential textual edit match perfectly, the evaluation result is correct."

The text content change from 'within doors' to 'within-doors' is accurately captured, preserving the essential intention of the correction. The prediction does not omit or misrepresent the core textual correction made. Line numbers were explicitly stated to be ignored, so the difference in line number does not affect accuracy. Therefore, both criteria\u2014edit type and text content accuracy\u2014are fully satisfied."
