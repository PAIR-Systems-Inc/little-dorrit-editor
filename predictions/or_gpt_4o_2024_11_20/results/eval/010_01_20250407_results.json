The additional context ('on') present in the prediction does not affect correctness, as the core edit accurately reflects the punctuation fix indicated by the ground truth. Thus, both the type and text content are accurately matched."

Regarding text content accuracy, the ground truth correction introduces a comma changing 'moment with' to 'moment, with'. The predicted correction also introduces a comma, changing 'for a moment with' into 'for a moment, with'. Even though the predicted edit includes additional contextual words ('for a'), it still accurately captures the critical core punctuation change designated by the ground truth. Therefore, the prediction correctly reflects the intended punctuation edit."
