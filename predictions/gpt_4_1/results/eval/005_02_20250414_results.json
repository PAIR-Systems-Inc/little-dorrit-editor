Regarding text content accuracy, the ground truth changes 'said Clennam' to 'asked Clennam' while the prediction specifies a narrower context 'said' to 'asked'. The prediction captures the core textual modification correctly, clearly identifying the intended verb change ('said' to 'asked'), though with slightly less context (omitting 'Clennam'). According to the instructions, additional or less context around the essential edit is acceptable as long as the core change itself is correctly identified. In this case, the prediction successfully meets both criteria."
