Regarding text content accuracy, the predicted edit includes additional context ('to-') following the primary edit ('why did he dine'), which is permissible since additional context does not compromise core edit accuracy. The essential capitalization correction ('why' \u2192 'Why') matches the ground truth intention exactly. Thus, the predicted edit correctly captures the intention of the ground truth edit."
