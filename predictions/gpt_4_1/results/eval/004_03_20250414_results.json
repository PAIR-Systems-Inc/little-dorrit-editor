The core correction from lowercase 'why' to capitalized 'Why' is accurately captured. Although the prediction includes extra context ('to-'), this does not affect the accuracy of the essential capitalization edit. Therefore, both 'Edit Type Accuracy' and the crucial 'Text Content Accuracy' criteria are satisfied, making the prediction correct."
