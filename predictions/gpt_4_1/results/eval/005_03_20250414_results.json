Regarding text accuracy, the essential edit of changing 'said' to 'asked' is captured accurately in both the ground truth ('said Clennam' \u2192 'asked Clennam') and the prediction ('said' \u2192 'asked'). The prediction simply omits the additional context ('Clennam'), which is allowed according to the instructions. Thus, both criteria are fully satisfied."
