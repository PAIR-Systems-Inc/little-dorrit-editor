The essential capitalization step from 'why did he dine' to 'Why did he dine' in the ground truth is correctly represented in the prediction ('why did he dine to-' to 'Why did he dine to-'). The prediction includes additional context ('to-') but correctly captures the core intended capitalization edit without changing any additional aspect. Therefore, both the edit type accuracy and core text content accuracy criteria are satisfied."
