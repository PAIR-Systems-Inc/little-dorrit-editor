      "judgement": "The edit type matches exactly as both ground truth and predicted edit are categorized as 'replacement'. The text content accuracy is also correct; the prediction accurately captures the replacement from 'dryest snorts' to 'driest of snorts'. Although the ground truth includes additional context ('of the dryest snorts.' to 'of the driest of snorts.'), the prediction contains the core change accurately ('dryest' changed to 'driest of'). Thus, both edit type and essential edit content are correctly matched."

      "judgement": "The predicted edit and ground truth both clearly indicate an italicization edit, matching exactly in edit type. The original ground truth edit specifies italicizing only the word 'him,' while the predicted edit italicizes a longer phrase containing 'him.' According to evaluation guidelines, extra context is allowed as long as the core change is correctly captured. Because 'him' (the key edit) is explicitly included and correctly italicized within the broader phrase of the prediction, the prediction accurately captures the essential intention of the ground truth edit."

Additionally, the predicted change specifically captures the identical text transformation from 'authorize' to 'authorise', matching the essential correction provided by the ground truth. Since line numbers are explicitly ignored per evaluation instructions, the slight discrepancy there does not affect this evaluation. The overall intent and exact content of the edit are fully captured by the prediction, making it correct."
