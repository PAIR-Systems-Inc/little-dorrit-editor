Both the original text ('Sun and Shadow') and corrected text ('Sun and Shadow.') are identical to the ground truth edit, clearly capturing the intended punctuation addition. Although line numbers differ, the instructions explicitly state to ignore line numbers. Thus, the prediction fully matches the edit type and core change described in the ground truth edit."
