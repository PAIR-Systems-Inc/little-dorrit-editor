Additionally, the text content ('length said' corrected to 'length, said') precisely mirrors the essential punctuation edit identified in the ground truth. Differences in line numbers are explicitly ignored based on the evaluation criteria, leaving no discrepancy in the meaningful evaluation points. Thus, the prediction fully captures the intended correction."
