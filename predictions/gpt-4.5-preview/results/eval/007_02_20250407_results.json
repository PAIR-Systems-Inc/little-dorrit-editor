Additionally, the core textual correction ('Sun and Shadow' to 'Sun and Shadow.') matches and precisely captures the intention indicated in the ground truth edit. Since we are explicitly asked to ignore line number discrepancies, there are no grounds on which to consider the prediction incorrect. Thus, both edit type and essential content changes are accurately captured."
