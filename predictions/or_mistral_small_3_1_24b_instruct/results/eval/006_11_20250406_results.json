The ground truth edit 'Clennam in' \u2192 'Clennam, in' is exactly replicated in the predicted edit, which captures the core punctuation change (a comma insertion after 'Clennam'). Although the line number and page differ, the evaluation explicitly instructs to ignore line numbers and page information and focus solely on the edit type and the core text content accuracy. Therefore, given that the edit type matches and the punctuation correction is exactly the same, the predicted edit correctly captures the intention of the ground truth edit."
