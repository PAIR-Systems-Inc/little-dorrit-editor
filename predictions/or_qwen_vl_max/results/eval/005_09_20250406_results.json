The presence of a period at the end of the predicted text ('said Clennam.' \u2192 'asked Clennam.') does not change the core meaning or the precise intention of the correction noted by the ground truth. Since additional punctuation or context beyond the primary change is allowed, the prediction accurately captures the essential textual edit intended by the ground truth."
