Additionally, the predicted change correctly reflects the core punctuation edit from \"yonder to-day\" to \"yonder, to-day.\" While the prediction includes more context (\"over yonder to-day\" instead of just \"yonder to-day\"), the essential punctuation change is precisely captured. Therefore, both the edit type and the essential text content correction adhere to the specified criteria."
