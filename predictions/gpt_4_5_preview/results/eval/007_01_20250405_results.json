The core textual correction identified by the ground truth ('Sun and Shadow' to 'Sun and Shadow.') is accurately captured by the prediction. Although the prediction includes a comma after 'Shadow' ('Sun and Shadow,'), the crucial punctuation correction intention (adding a period) is correctly identified. Differences in contextual punctuation before applying the edit do not affect the correctness, as the important intention\u2014changing or adding punctuation at the end\u2014is preserved."
