The textual content accuracy is also fully correct, as the prediction captures the exact punctuation change intended ('moment with' to 'moment, with'). Additional context or differing line numbers were explicitly disregarded according to instructions. Thus, both criteria (edit type and textual content) are accurately satisfied."
