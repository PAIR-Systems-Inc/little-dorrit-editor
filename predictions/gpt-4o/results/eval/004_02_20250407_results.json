Both the ground truth and prediction make the same essential capitalization change: changing 'why' to 'Why'. Although the ground truth mentions additional words ('why did he dine') versus just the single word ('why') in the prediction, this does not affect the essential core of the edit, which is focused specifically on capitalizing the first letter of the sentence. Ignoring line numbers as instructed, the predicted edit accurately captures the primary intention of the ground truth edit."
