Additionally, the predicted edit correctly identifies the text transformation from 'city' to 'City', matching precisely the core textual change indicated in the ground truth. Since line numbers are explicitly ignored according to the evaluation criteria, the discrepancy in line numbers does not affect the accuracy of the predicted edit. Therefore, the prediction fully captures the intent and content of the ground truth edit."

Regarding criterion 2 (text content accuracy), the predicted edit ('existence at' \u2192 'existence, at') correctly captures the essential edit from the ground truth ('existence' \u2192 'existence,') by inserting a comma directly after the word 'existence'. The additional context word 'at' in the prediction does not change the nature or accuracy of the core punctuation correction. Therefore, the prediction correctly captures the intention of the provided ground truth edit."

Although the predicted edit includes additional context ('by'), the essential punctuation correction (adding a comma after 'view') aligns exactly with the ground truth intention.
