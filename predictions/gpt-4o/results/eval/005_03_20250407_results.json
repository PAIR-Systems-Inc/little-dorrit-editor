Regarding text content, the essential edit captured by both ground truth ('if he' \u2192 'If he') and prediction ('if' \u2192 'If') is essentially the capitalization of the word 'if'. Although the predicted edit encompasses fewer words ('if' rather than 'if he'), the core intention of changing the first letter from lowercase to uppercase is correctly identified and captured. Extra context or words provided by the ground truth are allowed, and since the prediction accurately reflects the essential capitalized change, it meets the requirements for correctness."

Additionally, the core text change ('said' \u2192 'asked') correctly captures the essence of the ground truth edit ('said Clennam' \u2192 'asked Clennam'). Even though the predicted edit omits the additional context ('Clennam') provided in the ground truth, the essential correction\u2014changing 'said' to 'asked'\u2014is clearly identified. Thus, both edit type and the essential nature of the correction are correctly represented in the prediction."
