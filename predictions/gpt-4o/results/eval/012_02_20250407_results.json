The predicted correction ('existence, at') correctly incorporates the essential core punctuation change present in the ground truth ('existence' becoming 'existence,'), even though additional context ('at') is included. According to the evaluation criteria, inclusion of extra context is acceptable as long as the core correction (the comma insertion) is correctly captured. Thus, the predicted edit fully aligns with the ground truth's intended correction."

The predicted text ('view by' to 'view, by') correctly captures the core punctuation change of adding a comma after 'view', as specified in the ground truth ('view' to 'view,'). The additional text 'by' in the prediction is permissible since it only provides additional context and does not alter or obscure the intended punctuation edit.

      "judgement": "The edit type ('punctuation') matches exactly between ground truth and prediction. Concerning text content accuracy, the core change in the ground truth was to adjust punctuation from 'existence,' to 'existence;'. The predicted edit correctly reflects this change: it converts 'existence is' into 'existence; is', essentially capturing the identical punctuation replacement (comma to semicolon) around the word 'existence'. Although the prediction includes the additional context word 'is', the fundamental correction \u2014 the punctuation replacement after the word 'existence' \u2014 aligns precisely with the ground truth intent. Additional contextual words do not negate accuracy in this evaluation."
