For the 'text content accuracy', the essential punctuation correction the ground truth specifies\u2014adding a comma after the word 'pockets'\u2014is correctly captured by the prediction (changing 'pockets and' to 'pockets, and'). Although the prediction includes an additional word ('rattling') after 'and', this is acceptable, as extra context does not affect correctness. Therefore, both criteria are satisfied."
