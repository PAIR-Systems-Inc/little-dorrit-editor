Additionally, the predicted change from \"hers matters\" to \"hers, matters\" is identical in both examples. Since the evaluation guidelines specify ignoring differences in line numbers, no issues exist with line number discrepancies. Thus, both the edit type and the core textual correction align precisely, resulting in a correct evaluation."
