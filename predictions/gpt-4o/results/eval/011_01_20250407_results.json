Additionally, the corrected text 'shore, and' accurately reflects the punctuation change specified in the ground truth edit ('shore and' \u2192 'shore, and'). Even though there is a difference in the indicated line numbers, this evaluation explicitly instructs to disregard line numbers. Therefore, since both type and core content changes match perfectly, the prediction is correct."

Although the predicted edit provides extra context by including the word 'once', this does not contradict or alter the core intended correction from 'that' to 'than'. Thus, the essential textual correction is properly identified and the edit type is correct, fulfilling both required criteria."
