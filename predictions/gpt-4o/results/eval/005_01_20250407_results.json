Although the predicted edit has slightly reduced context ('said' \u2192 'asked') compared to the ground truth ('said Clennam' \u2192 'asked Clennam'), it accurately captures and represents the core intended change (replacing 'said' with 'asked'). Extra context before or after the essential edit is permitted according to the evaluation instructions. Thus, both edit type and the central textual change are accurately captured."
