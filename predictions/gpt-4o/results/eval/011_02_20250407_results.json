Additionally, the predicted correction ('shore and' \u2192 'shore, and') precisely captures the core punctuation change presented in the ground truth edit. The slight variation in line numbers is explicitly ignored, and no other discrepancies are found. Thus, the predicted edit correctly captures the intention of the ground truth edit."

Additionally, the essential text change from 'that' to 'than' is correctly captured by the prediction. The prediction includes an additional word ('once'), providing extra context on the surrounding text, which is permissible according to evaluation guidelines. Therefore, the prediction correctly captures both edit type and core text content accuracy."
