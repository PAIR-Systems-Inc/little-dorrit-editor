Regarding text content accuracy, both specify the change from 'beautiful that' to 'beautiful, that', indicating the insertion of a comma after the word 'beautiful'.

Differences in line numbers have been explicitly ignored per instructions, thus the prediction is fully correct in capturing the intended edit."
