Moreover, it accurately captures the core change intended by the ground truth: changing punctuation from no punctuation (or incorrect punctuation) after 'Shadow' to 'Shadow.' Although the predicted edit incorrectly cited the original text as having a comma ('Sun and Shadow,'), the essential correction identified by the ground truth was adding (or modifying to) a period at the end. Thus, despite this minor inconsistency in the representation of the original punctuation, the core intended punctuation edit ('Sun and Shadow' \u2192 'Sun and Shadow.') is accurately captured. Therefore, the predicted edit is considered correct."
