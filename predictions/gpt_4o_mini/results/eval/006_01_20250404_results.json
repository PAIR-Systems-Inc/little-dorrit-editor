Additionally, the core punctuation correction ('said' \u2192 'said,') is correctly captured within the predicted edit ('said (' \u2192 'said, ('). The prediction includes additional context (the '(' character), but since the instructions explicitly allow additional context as long as the essential correction is properly captured, this does not affect correctness. Overall, the prediction accurately captures both the edit type and essential text content correction of the ground truth."

The difference in line numbers and page numbers is intentionally ignored based on instructions, thus the prediction correctly captures the intention of the ground truth edit."
