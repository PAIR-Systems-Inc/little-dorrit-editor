Regarding text content accuracy, the ground truth specifies changing 'cold stones!' into 'cold stones?', and the prediction covers this exact punctuation change. The additional context in the prediction ('the' preceding 'cold stones?') does not affect the core punctuation adjustment. Since the essential edit\u2014the punctuation correction from '!' to '?'\u2014has been correctly captured by the prediction, it fully aligns with the intention of the ground truth edit."
