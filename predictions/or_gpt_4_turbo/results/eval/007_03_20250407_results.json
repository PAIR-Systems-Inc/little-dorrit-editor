      "judgement": "The predicted edit accurately matches the ground truth edit. Specifically, the edit type 'punctuation' matches exactly, and the text content captures the essential change from 'Sun and Shadow' to 'Sun and Shadow.' precisely. The slight discrepancy in line numbers was explicitly instructed to be ignored, and thus does not affect the evaluation. Therefore, the prediction fulfills both criteria of edit type accuracy and text content accuracy."
