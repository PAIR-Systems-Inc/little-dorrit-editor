Secondly, the textual correction accurately captures the intentional punctuation addition; both the original and the corrected text provided in the prediction ('Sun and Shadow' \u2192 'Sun and Shadow.') exactly match the core punctuation addition from the ground truth. Although the page and line number differ, according to the evaluation instruction, line numbers (and therefore implicitly page numbers as well) should be ignored. Thus, the prediction is considered correct."
