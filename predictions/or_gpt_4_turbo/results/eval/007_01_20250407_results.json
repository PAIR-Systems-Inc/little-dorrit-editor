Additionally, the text content change identified by the ground truth ('Sun and Shadow' to 'Sun and Shadow.') is accurately reflected in the predicted edit. The minor difference in line number has been explicitly disregarded based on evaluation instructions. Therefore, the prediction correctly captures the core intention of the ground truth correction."
