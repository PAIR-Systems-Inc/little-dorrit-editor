The text content accuracy is also correct, as both ground truth and predicted edits show the original text 'Sun and Shadow' being corrected to 'Sun and Shadow.' by adding a period. No discrepancies in type or core change are found. Line numbers explicitly instructed to be ignored, making this prediction fully correct."
