Despite the ground truth including additional context ('if he' \u2192 'If he'), the core capitalization edit (the lowercase 'i' in 'if' corrected to uppercase 'I') has been accurately captured in the predicted edit ('if' \u2192 'If'). Therefore, both the edit type and the key textual correction effectively match the ground truth's intention."
