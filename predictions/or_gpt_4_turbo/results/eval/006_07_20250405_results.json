Regarding text content accuracy, the ground truth edit changes \"said when\" to \"said, when,\" explicitly indicating the addition of a comma immediately after \"said.\" The prediction similarly captures the core punctuation change by indicating \"said\" corrected to \"said,\" explicitly pinpointing the same comma insertion. Although the predicted edit includes slightly less context (\"said\" instead of \"said when\"), it accurately captures the essential punctuation change intended by the ground truth. Therefore, both criteria\u2014edit type and essential punctuation change\u2014are correctly satisfied by the predicted edit."
