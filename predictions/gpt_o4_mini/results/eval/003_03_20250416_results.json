Since line numbers are explicitly ignored for this evaluation, and the essential edit (adding a period punctuation mark at the end of the text) is correctly captured, the prediction is correct."

      "judgement": "The predicted edit correctly matches the edit type ('punctuation') exactly. The ground truth clarifies a punctuation correction, changing 'howling over' to 'howling, over'. The predicted edit similarly shows the corrected punctuation clearly as 'howling, over'. The absence of a space in the predicted original text ('howling,over') compared to the ground truth ('howling over') is permissible, as the essential punctuation edit itself ('howling' to 'howling,') is captured accurately. Additional context or slight spacing difference does not affect the core intention of the punctuation correction. Thus, the predicted edit successfully captures the ground truth intention."
