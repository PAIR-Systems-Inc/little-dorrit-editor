Additionally, the essential textual change, adding a hyphen between 'high' and 'road', is correctly captured in the prediction. Although the predicted edit uses the Unicode character '\\u2011' (non-breaking hyphen) instead of the standard hyphen '-', the intention of punctuation correction (hyphenation) remains clearly and accurately conveyed. Therefore, both the edit type and essential text content align correctly, making the prediction accurate."

Hence, both the edit type and textual content accuracy are fully satisfied."

This extra context does not alter the core correction intended by the ground truth (adding a comma after 'said'). The prediction correctly captures the essential punctuation edit, satisfying both criteria."
