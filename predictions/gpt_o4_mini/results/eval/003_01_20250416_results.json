The text content change also matches precisely, 'howling over' \u2192 'howling, over'. Even though line numbers differ, the instructions explicitly state these should be ignored. Therefore, since both the edit type and the essential text edit match exactly, the predicted edit correctly captures the ground truth's intention."

Specifically, both the edit type ('punctuation') and the core textual correction ('yonder to-day' changed to 'yonder, to-day') are the same. Although the line numbers differ, the evaluation instructions explicitly state to ignore line numbers completely. Thus, the prediction successfully captures the essential edit that the ground truth intended."
