(2) The text content accuracy is sufficient, as the ground truth edit involves adding a comma after the word 'said' (changing 'said when' to 'said, when'), and the prediction identifies the core punctuation change correctly ('said' to 'said,'). Although the predicted edit provides more limited context (omitting the word 'when'), it still accurately captures the essential correction the ground truth intended."
