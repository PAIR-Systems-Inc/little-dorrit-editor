      "judgement": "The predicted edit type matches exactly with the ground truth (both are 'punctuation'). For text content accuracy, both the original text ('Sun and Shadow') and the corrected text ('Sun and Shadow.') are identical between the predicted edit and ground truth. The sole difference is the line number, which the instructions explicitly state should be ignored. Thus, the prediction correctly represents the punctuation addition from the ground truth edit."
