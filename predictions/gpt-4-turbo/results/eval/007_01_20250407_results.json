The original text ('Sun and Shadow') and the corrected text ('Sun and Shadow.') align precisely with the provided ground truth change. Differences in line numbers are explicitly instructed to be ignored, and there are no discrepancies in the type or essential textual edit details. Thus, the prediction correctly captures the intended edit."
