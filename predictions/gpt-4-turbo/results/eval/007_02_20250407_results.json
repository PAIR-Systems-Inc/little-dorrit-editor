Additionally, the corrected text content ('Sun and Shadow' \u2192 'Sun and Shadow.') precisely captures the core punctuation change indicated by the ground truth. Line numbers were explicitly ignored in this evaluation, thus despite the discrepancy in line numbers, both type and text content accuracy meet the criteria required for correctness."
