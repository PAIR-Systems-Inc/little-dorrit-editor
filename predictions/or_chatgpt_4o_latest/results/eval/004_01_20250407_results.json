The ground truth edit changes 'why did he dine' to 'Why did he dine', primarily focusing on capitalizing 'why' to 'Why'. The predicted edit isolates the word 'why', correctly identifying and applying the exact capitalization correction. According to evaluation instructions, predictions capturing the core change are considered correct, even if context differs in quantity. Thus, the predicted edit accurately captures the essential edit intended in the ground truth."
