In terms of text content accuracy, the ground truth edit involved adding a comma directly after 'existence'. The predicted edit also correctly captured this core punctuation change ('existence' \u2192 'existence,') while additionally including the subsequent word 'at'. Since additional context does not affect correctness, the prediction accurately reflects the essential punctuation correction specified in the ground truth."

(2) The predicted edit ('motionless, when') properly includes the core punctuation correction from the ground truth ('motionless' \u2192 'motionless,'). The additional context ('when') included in the predicted edit does not affect correctness, as per evaluation instructions.

The ground truth is changing a comma to a semicolon in the text 'stand-still,' \u2192 'stand-still;'. The prediction correctly captures this essential punctuation edit ('stand-still to' \u2192 'stand-still; to'). Although the prediction includes additional context ('to'), it still accurately represents the core punctuation change identified in the ground truth. Therefore, both the edit type and the text content accurately match the ground truth's intention."

For text content accuracy, the ground truth edit is 'view' \u2192 'view,', and the predicted edit is 'view by' \u2192 'view, by'. The core change ('view' becoming 'view,') is accurately captured. Although the prediction includes an additional word ('by'), it retains the fundamental punctuation insertion intention of the ground truth.
