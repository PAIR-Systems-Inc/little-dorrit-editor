In terms of text content, the ground truth indicates the punctuation addition ('said when' \u2192 'said, when'), highlighting the insertion of a comma after 'said'. The predicted edit correctly captures this exact punctuation addition ('said' \u2192 'said,'). Although the prediction omits the subsequent context ('when'), it clearly identifies the CORE punctuation change\u2014the insertion of the comma after the word 'said'. Since additional context is allowed and the main intended punctuation correction has been accurately identified, the predicted edit correctly reflects the intention of the ground truth."
