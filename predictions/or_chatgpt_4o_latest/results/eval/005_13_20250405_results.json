Regarding text content, the predicted edit accurately captures the core textual change from 'said' to 'asked'. Although the predicted edit omits 'Clennam', this is acceptable based on provided instructions, which allow omission of context as long as the essential edit (the actual word replacement 'said' to 'asked') is accurately represented. Hence, both criteria (edit type accuracy and essential text content accuracy) are correctly fulfilled."
