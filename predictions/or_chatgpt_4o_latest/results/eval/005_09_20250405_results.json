      "judgement": "The predicted edit correctly matches the edit type: both ground truth and prediction are 'capitalization'. The text content accuracy criterion is also satisfied; the essential capitalization edit from 'if' to 'If' is precisely reflected. Although the ground truth includes an adjacent word ('he'), the core correction\u2014capitalizing 'if'\u2014is correctly captured in the prediction. Therefore, the prediction accurately represents the ground truth's intended edit."

      "judgement": "The predicted edit matches the ground truth edit accurately in two key aspects: First, the edit type 'replacement' exactly matches. Second, the predicted replacement ('said' \u2192 'asked') faithfully captures the core textual change shown in the ground truth ('said Clennam' \u2192 'asked Clennam'). Although the predicted content omits the name 'Clennam', the core correction ('said' changed to 'asked') remains clearly and accurately represented, fulfilling the criteria defined for text content accuracy."
