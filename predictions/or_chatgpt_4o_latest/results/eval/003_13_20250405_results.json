The difference in 'page' naming ('003.png' vs 'page_19') is irrelevant as per instructions, and the line number is explicitly ignored. Thus, both the edit type and the text content are accurately captured, satisfying the evaluation criteria."

The differences in the page identifier (ground truth '003.png' versus prediction 'page_19') and the line numbers were instructed to be ignored, thus these variations do not impact accuracy. Overall, both criteria\u2014edit type and text content accuracy\u2014are fully met."
