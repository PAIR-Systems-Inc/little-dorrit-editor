The text content change from 'said Clennam' to 'asked Clennam' is correctly identified in the prediction as 'said' to 'asked'. Although the prediction includes less context ('said' versus 'said Clennam'), it still clearly captures the essential textual modification ('said' to 'asked'). According to the evaluation criterion allowing additional or lesser context if the core edit is retained, this prediction is correct."
