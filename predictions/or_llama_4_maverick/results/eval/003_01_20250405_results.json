The text content accuracy criterion is also satisfied; both the original and corrected text, 'pockets and' changed to 'pockets, and', are identical in the ground truth and predicted edits. Thus, the prediction fully captures the exact intent and type of the ground truth edit, regardless of discrepancies in line numbers or page identifiers, which were explicitly ignored as per instructions."
