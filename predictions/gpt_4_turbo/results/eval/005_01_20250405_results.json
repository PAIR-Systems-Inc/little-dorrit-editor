The ground truth edit ('if he' \u2192 'If he') addresses capitalization change specifically in the first word of the text ('if' to 'If'). The predicted edit ('if' \u2192 'If') correctly captures and reproduces precisely this core capitalization change. Although the predicted text captures only the first word and omits the subsequent word ('he'), it accurately represents the essential capitalization edit the ground truth intended. The prediction meets both specified criteria\u2014proper edit type and capturing the core change. Hence, the prediction is correct."

The predicted change from 'said' to 'asked' clearly captures the core correction intended by the ground truth ('said Clennam' \u2192 'asked Clennam'). Although the predicted edit omits 'Clennam', this does not alter the essence of the correction. The main correction\u2014replacing 'said' with 'asked'\u2014is accurately represented. Therefore, the edit is considered correct."
