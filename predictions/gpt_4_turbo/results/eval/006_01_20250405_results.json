Regarding text content accuracy, the ground truth edit changes 'said when' to 'said, when', clearly indicating the addition of a comma after 'said'. The predicted edit identifies precisely the same punctuation addition ('said' \u2192 'said,'), and while it does not explicitly include 'when' in the original or corrected text, this extra context omission is allowable according to evaluation criteria. The essential core change\u2014the insertion of a comma\u2014is accurately captured. Thus, the predicted edit is correct as it correctly matches both the edit type and the essential textual change indicated in the ground truth."
