The predicted text correction ('Sun and Shadow' \u2192 'Sun and Shadow.') also perfectly captures the core change identified in the ground truth edit, which was simply the insertion of a period. Thus, ignoring line numbers as instructed, the prediction accurately captures the intention of the ground truth edit."
