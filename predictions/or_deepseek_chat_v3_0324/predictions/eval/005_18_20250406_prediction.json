Without seeing the content, I cannot accurately identify corrections.\n\nTo properly complete this task, I would need:\n1. The printed text (either as text or an image)\n2. Any handwritten markups visible on the page\n3. The page identifier/reference\n\nCould you please provide:\n- The text content (or an image of the page)\n- Any visible handwritten corrections\n- The page number or identifier?\n\nWith this information, I can then:\n1. Analyze the original printed text\n2. Identify all handwritten corrections\n3. Categorize each correction by type\n4. Provide the structured JSON output you requested\n\nThe output will follow exactly the format you specified, with separate entries for each individual correction."
